# G-quAI-Pipelines

This repository serves as the central hub for the **G-quAI** project. Our mission is to leverage quantum computing to build more accurate, AI models for diagnosing and preventing gastrointestinal (GI) cancers.

## Our Approaches

We are exploring two distinct quantum computing paradigms to tackle the challenges of medical image analysis. Each approach is developed in its own dedicated repository, linked below.

### 1. [**Neutral-Atom-QGARS**](https://github.com/NunoMBatista/Neutral-Atom-QGARS/tree/main "null")

This repository contains our implementation of an **analog quantum computing** pipeline using **Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC)** on a neutral-atom platform. It features a **Quantum-Guided Autoencoder with a Reservoir Surrogate (QGARS)** to create high-dimensional quantum embeddings for a classical linear classifier.

### 2. [**Superconducting-Neural-Network**](https://github.com/NunoMBatista/Superconducting-Neural-Network/tree/main "null")

This repository contains our implementation of a **circuit based quantum computing** pipeline using a **Quantum Neural Network (QNN)** designed for gate-based superconducting hardware. The model uses the Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) and a variational quantum circuit to classify images.
